# Number Guessing Game 

## Summary
This Java program implements a simple number guessing game. The game generates a random number between 10 and 100, and the player attempts to guess the correct number. The program provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guess is higher or lower than the generated number. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number, and the program displays the total number of attempts made.

## How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. The program generates a random number between 10 and 100.
3. Enter your guess when prompted.
4. Receive feedback on whether your guess is higher or lower than the correct number.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 until you correctly guess the number.
6. The program displays the number of attempts made to guess the correct number.

## Code Overview
